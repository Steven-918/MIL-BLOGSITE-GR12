            <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; What was your perception of the media before this lesson? What is your view of media now? &quot;</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The emergence of digital media has had a significant impact on traditional media channels like newspapers and television. More consumers today use online platforms, social media streaming services, and mobile applications to access news and entertainment. The manner in which media is created, disseminated, and consumed has changed as a result.
        </p>
        <p>
            I must admit that before this lecture, I didn't give the media much thought. It simply existed continuously, like background noise. I generally used it for enjoyment, keeping up with current events, and occasionally getting lost in the internet's collection of amusing cat videos. I didn't give any thought to how it would affect our culture or how it affects how we perceive things.
        </p>
        <p>
            But now that I've learned this lesson, I clearly see the media's influence and strength. I understand that it's not just about providing people with entertainment or information; it's also about influencing people's opinions, thoughts, and even emotions. It's important to use caution and discernment when consuming media because it can be utilized for both positive and evil purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also discovered that the media is a complicated ecology with a variety of sources, biases, and agendas rather than a single, monolithic corporation. Some media sources are more trustworthy than others, therefore it's crucial to look for different viewpoints to get a more complete picture of any problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            In short, I no longer view the media as something I take for granted, but rather as a potent force that demands serious thought and study. Its potential impact on our lives and society at large has come to my attention.

        <h3>
            <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; What is the most relevant function of media to you? Why? &quot;</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The public can be informed and educated by the media on a variety of subjects, such as politics, science, technology, health, culture, and more. People can make educated judgments and take part in democratic processes when they are knowledgeable about local, national, and international events. The ability of media to bring people together, share experiences, and start conversations is, in my opinion, its most important purpose. We congregate around it like a virtual campfire to share thoughts, stories, and feelings. Let me summarize it for you:
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="numbering">1.</span> <span class="misc7">Connection</span>: We can communicate with individuals from all over the world thanks to the media, which comes in many forms such as social media, television, and the internet. It allows us to see how others live, think, and feel while bridging geographic distances. Even though we have never met in person, it feels like we have pals all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="numbering">2.</span> <span class="misc7">Storytelling</span>: The modern day storyteller is the media. It presents stories that inform, entertain, and occasionally inspire us in order to help us understand the world better, whether through news articles, movies, or Instagram stories. It resembles an endless repository of human knowledge and experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="numbering">3.</span> <span class="misc7">Conversation Starter</span>: The media gives us a platform for conversation. We start discussing when we read a provocative article or see a contentious documentary. We test our own beliefs, exchange ideas with others, and learn from them. It's comparable to the best icebreaker at a large party.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="numbering">4.</span> <span class="misc7">Reflection of Society</span>: Our beliefs, fears, and goals as a society are reflected in the media. It serves as a mirror to our culture, illuminating the things we value, decry, and need to improve. It functions as a feedback loop to keep us developing.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="numbering">5.</span> <span class="misc7">Empowerment</span>: The media gives people and groups a voice. People can express themselves, promote causes, and affect change through blogging, vlogging, or even TikTok dances. It's similar to giving anyone with a message the megaphone.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="numbering">6.</span> <span class="misc7">Entertainment</span>: Let's not forget the fun part! Media entertains us, allowing us to escape from our daily routines, laugh, cry, and be amazed. It's like a magical portal to other worlds, right at our fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>
            So in easy way to say, the most relevant function of media to me is its ability to connect us, tell our stories, start conversations, reflect our society, empower individuals, and provide endless entertainment. It's like a vibrant tapestry of human experiences that enriches our lives in countless ways.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <span class="misc8">&bull;</span> <span class="misc9">&quot; Recall a recent situation wherein media and information literacy could have been useful and how as. &quot;</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            A vital skill is media and information literacy. It describes the capacity to access, assess, and evaluate numerous media and information sources. Understanding how the media operates, being able to assess the reliability and veracity of sources, and using information responsibly are all part of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recently came across this pretty surprising headline while reading through my social media page. I'm a bit of a science fiction buff, so my initial reaction was enthusiasm, like, "Wow, this is amazing!" But then, I thought, "Hold on a second, is this for real?" It read something like, "Aliens have landed on Earth, and they're taking over!"
        </p>
        <p>
            I then understood how extremely helpful media and information literacy could have been. I made the choice to do a little more research before I instantly shared the headline with all of my friends after believing it. I opened the article by clicking on it. It turned out that the article had no reliable sources or quotes from experts and had been put on a website that I had never heard of. The more I thought about it, the more it appeared to be a clickbait headline created to attract attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, if I hadn't been media literate, I might have fallen for it and started spreading the news like wildfire. But because I had a basic understanding of media literacy, I decided not to share it and waited for more reliable sources to confirm or deny the story.
        </p>
        <p>
            The "alien invasion" incident turned proved to be a hoax, and no reliable news sources covered it. We obviously want to prevent the spread of false information, so if I had shared it out of the blue, I might have contributed to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, media and information literacy came to my rescue in this case by enabling me to examine the material I found critically and come to a more informed conclusion about whether or not to believe it and spread it. In our era of fake news and digital information overload, it's a skill that's growing more and more crucial, therefore we should all work to master it.
