            <span class="misc10">SETTING</span> &dash; The documentary unfolds in the vibrant city of Taguig and various other cities scattered across the sprawling metropolis of Manila.

        <p>
            <span class="misc10">MISE-EN-SCÃˆNE</span> &dash; The visual storytelling of this documentary is a masterful composition, capturing scenes from diverse locales along the Pasig River. It employs a spectrum of camera angles, including low, high, tilted, and neutral perspectives, creating a dynamic visual narrative that immerses the viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">ACTING</span> &dash; The central figure in this documentary is a person of remarkable determination.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">COLOR</span> &dash; The use of color in this documentary serves as a powerful tool for evoking mood and ambiance.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">EDITING</span> &dash; Employing the "eye trace" technique as a storytelling tool, the documentary seamlessly wove together various settings, captivating the viewer's attention through continuity editing. This approach ensured a smooth and engaging narrative flow, allowing the audience to effortlessly follow the storyline.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">AUDIO</span> &dash; Within this documentary, Foley sounds took center stage, strategically integrated to enhance the existing sound design. Foley sound effects were meticulously crafted to replicate real-life sounds using props and other elements, adding layers of realism to each scene. This auditory craftsmanship aimed to immerse the audience more deeply into the storytelling experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">LIGHTING</span> &dash; The documentary employed a deliberate choice of low and gloomy lighting to artistically mirror the lives of its subjects. This evocative use of lighting served as a visual metaphor, emphasizing the hardships and challenges faced by those whose stories were being told, while also creating a distinctive and impactful atmosphere that resonated throughout the film.

        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="misc10">DESIGN & LAYOUT</span> &dash; The documentary employs a compelling dramatization design that skillfully transports viewers to pivotal moments in the subject's life, immersing them within the narrative.
